# PackageLabelReader
Android Studio project reads from and to addresses and related details(upon modification) from package labels
Built using Firebase ML Kit, and Geocoder API

# Usage
This app has uses in 
1) Security department: where hundreds of packages enter everyday, so an automated software to record their details would be helpful
2) Delivery departments and Online stores: The details on the packages exiting the building can be verified automatically using this software.

# Getting Started

1) Download the PackageLabelReaderr.zip and unzip it to obtain the Android Studio project.
2) Create a Firebase account and add the google json file you'll be getting into the Android studio project under the app directory
3) (Optional) For better performance, if you are using this project at a later date compared to when it was uploaded, update the Firebase and Geocoder API version in the gradle and xml files.
4) Build and run!

Note: This app assumes the standard form of printing package labels, with From address at the top and To address below it. In case of modifications to this format, accuracy of the app may be compromised.

# TODO
1) Create a demo video
2) Upload demo pictures of the running app.
